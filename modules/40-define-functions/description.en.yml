name: Function definition
description: |
  Defining your own functions makes writing and maintaining programs much easier. The ability to define functions, for example, allows complex (composite) operations to be merged into a single operation, with the complexity hidden behind a simple function. Learn to write functions and take the first step toward creating truly useful programs. This module will teach you how to name functions (as well as variables and constants) and create your own.
